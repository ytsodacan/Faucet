   the device context to use for rendering, and the width/height of render target textures.

   The width/height is used solely for sizing internal rendertargets. They will be
   allocated to the larger of this size and the size of any rendered tiles (with padding).
   In other words, you can pass in (0,0) and the rendertargets will be allocated to the
   right size. However, if you draw multiple Iggy files or tiles of different sizes,
   they might first be allocated too small; it's best to pass in the correct size initially
   to avoid unnecessary allocation/deallocation of too-small rendertargets.

   There can only be one D3D GDraw context active at any one time.

   If initialization fails for some reason (the main reason would be an out of memory condition),
   NULL is returned. Otherwise, you can pass the return value to IggySetGDraw. */

   If your rendertarget uses multisampling, you also need to specify a shader
   resource view for a non-MSAA rendertarget texture (identically sized to main_rt)
   in non_msaa_rt. This is only used if the Flash content includes non-standard

   This can be used to get an estimate of how much graphics memory got used by GDraw
   during the last frame.

   For the dynbuffer, this always returns 0 in handles_used and the *size of the largest
   single allocation* in bytes_used. It needs to be sized so that this allocation fits;
   make it smaller and it won't work, but if you make it much larger (say more than 2x
   as big), it's just a waste of memory. That said, we still recommend to make it no
   smaller than 64k, and the default is 256k.

   Caveat: This counts the number of bytes that GDraw knows about. 3D hardware usually
   has its own management overhead, alignment requirements, allocation granularity
   and so on. In short, this is not an accurate estimate of how much memory is actually
   used by the GPU - it is a lower bound, though, and makes for a useful ballpark estimate. */
