/* Sets up the resource pools that GDraw uses for its video memory management.
   
   It sets both the number of handles and the address and size of memory to use.
   GDraw keeps track of allocations in each pool, and will free old resources in
   a LRU manner to make space if one of the limits is about to be exceeded. It will
   also automatically defragment memory if necessary to fulfill an allocation
   request.

   You need to set up all of the resource pools before you can start rendering.
   If you modify this at runtime, you need to call IggyPlayerFlushAll on all
   active Iggys (if any) since this call invalidates all resource handles they
   currently hold.

   SetResourceMemory takes a void* argument for the address of the resource pool.
   Pass in NULL and zero bytes to reset a specific pool.

   Resource pool memory has certain alignment requirements - see the #defines
   above. If you pass in an unaligned pointer, GDraw will automatically clip off
   some bytes at the front to make the buffer aligned - in other words, you get
   somewhat less usable bytes, but it should work fine.

   "rendertarget" memory is only used during Iggy rendering. In other words, you
   are free to use that memory for other purposes such as your own render targets
   or depth buffers as long as it doesn't need to be preserved across IggyPlayerDraw*
   calls. 

   If any Iggy draw calls are in flight, this call will block waiting for
   those calls to finish (i.e. for the resource memory to become
   unused).
*/

/* Frees all resource pools managed by GDraw.

   Use this as a quick way of freeing (nearly) all memory allocated by GDraw
   without shutting it down completely. For example, you might want to use this
   to quickly flush all memory allocated by GDraw when transitioning between the
   main menu and the game proper. Like with SetResourceMemory, you need to call
   IggyPlayerFlushAll on all currently active Iggy players if you do this - although
   we recommend that you only use this function when there aren't any. */

   area in video shared memory that is GDRAW_ORBIS_CONTEXT_MEM_SIZE bytes big - this is
   used by GDraw to store labels and shaders in.

   There can only be one GDraw context active at any one time.

   NULL is returned. Otherwise, you can pass the return value to IggySetGDraw. */

   address and size of the staging buffer used for dynamic vertex data and in-frame
   resource uploads. Any GDraw / Iggy rendering calls outside a Begin / End bracket
   are an error and will be treated as such. The GfxContext must be live during the
   entire Begin / End bracket.

   GDraw maintains a persistent resource cache shared across all Iggys. Because of this,
   it is *vital* that all GfxContexts generated from GDraw be kicked in the order
   they were generated, or the resource pools might get corrupted. Hence it's recommended
   to use only one GfxContext for all Iggy rendering during a frame.

   The staging buffer should be allocated in write-combined memory. If it is of insufficient
   size, GDraw will not be able to allocate dynamic vertex data or upload new texture/vertex
   buffer data during some frames, resulting in glitching! (When this happens, it will be
   reported as a warning, so make sure to install a warning callback).

   The user is expected to handle GfxContext and staging buffer synchronization; there are
   no safeguards on the GDraw side to prevent CPU-GPU race conditions. Please make sure that
   the GPU is finished with a GfxContext / staging buffer before reusing its memory!
   Typically, this would be accomplished by double buffering everything. */

   or staging buffer after this call, so you are free to append other rendering commands after
   this call returns.

   was actually used and which allocations were attempted. If you're not interested, just

   will be used if the render target has them enabled. Note that if fast clears are enabled,
   you also need to call gdraw_orbis_EliminateFastClears once you're done with the render target
   to make sure the clears are actually properly completed.
